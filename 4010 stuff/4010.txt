Tektronix 4010 hardware notes.

Cable that works reliably:

Osborne RS232 connector:
1 frame ground
2 transmit data: input
3 receive data: output
4 request to send (high or nc enables)
5 clear to send (held high)
6 data set ready (held high)
7 signal ground
8 carrier detect (held high)

Tektronix data board connector
1 receive data "direct to CPU": input
2 gnd
3 held high
4 gnd
5 gnd
6 held high
7 transmit data "direct to modem": output

The original cable had a special plug at the Tektronix end and no plug at the other.
This had signal crossover problems at 1200 BAUD: data being sent from the Tektronix
would arrive at the Osborne okay, but it would leak into the return wire and come back
to the Tektronix as garbage.
I made a new cable using two shielded wires, one for each data direction:
Osborne RS232#2 to Tektronix#7
Osborne RS232#3 to Tektronix#1
I grounded the shield at the Osborne One end but not at the other. The Osborne screen
loses vertican sync when I connect grounds to the tektronix, whether to frame or signal
ground.
